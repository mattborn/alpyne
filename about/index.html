        <h3>Nobody wants to build dashboards.</h3>
        <p class="bigger-copy">
          Accounting and finance are in my DNA. My grandfather was an Assistant Commissioner of the IRS and my family
          reunions feature more CPAs than a KPMG happy hour. So despite starting my career as an engineer, it was
          inevitable that I would end up in the world of accounting.
        </p>
        <p class="bigger-copy">
          After spending a decade as a full-time CFO in the tech world, I ended up engaging a portfolio of clients as a
          fractional CFO. While this was rewarding in a number of ways, I found that I was frustrated by having to
          navigate all my clients’ systems and data sources. I was spending more time moving numbers around, and less
          time being a strategic partner. I built Alpyne to solve this problem for myself, and now I’m making it
          available to you.
        </p>
        <p class="bigger-copy">
          I’ve worked with some great finance and accounting professionals over the years. I’ve learned something new
          from each of them and how they solve challenging problems for their clients in creative ways. They’re
          strategic, dedicated and hard-working. Alpyne isn’t a replacement to this unique value that CFOs offer.
          Instead, I built Alpyne to solve some of the more manual, repetitive tasks they’re faced with day-in and
          day-out—so they can focus on growing their business, deepening their relationships and turning their financial
          expertise into a true competitive advantage.
