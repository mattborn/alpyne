create a new jamstack marketing site with index.html, styles.css, and scripts.js in /alpyne that has a hero section with the heading "Stop wrangling client data. Automate it." and a button to "Get a demo" and a fully interactive preview of the application in a fake browser centered immediately after the hero header, a simple quote section that i will swap the text out, and a pain points section with 6 cards including a header and text, and 5 sections with text on one side and graphic on the other alternating, and a process section with 5 columns of stacked text, and a footer with the text "Copyright Â© 2025 Alpyne" and keep all the sections constructed the same way (see: /code-2024/mattborn/joeyhendrix.com and /code-2024/moonadesign/focalconsulting.co) and stub out two more static pages at /alpyne/about and /alpyne/migrate respectively that get linked from the top of the main landing page, and keep the feel modern and minimalistic and keep the code as minimal as possible
