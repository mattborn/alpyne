      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        We at Alpyne are committed to protecting your privacy and that of your clients. This Privacy Policy explains our
        data processing practices when you visit our site and use our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of personal information via the Site and/or the Services. By
        accessing the Site and/or otherwise using the Services you represent that you have read, understand, and agree
        to the use of your information in accordance with, the Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect and Store</h2>
      <p>
        When you agree to a trial of our services we will collect your name, company name, phone number, email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on which features of our product you use, we may collect the following data from you, or your clients'
        systems if you are representing another company:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accounting and financial data</li>
        <li>CRM data</li>
        <li>Sales and Billing Data</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>At no time do we ever collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment information, including credit card numbers</li>
        <li>Bank account information</li>
        <li>
          Certain sensitive personal information, including social security numbers, employee addresses or birthdates
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse,
        and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We always use TLS encryption, a cryptographic
        protocol designed for privacy and data security. Additionally, all of our data infrastructure is hosted by
        Amazon Web Services and comes with all the protection offered by AWS.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among
        other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or
        can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or
        compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, or otherwise share, your or your clients' data with other entities.</p>

      <h2>Your Control of Data</h2>
      <p>In addition to the measures described above, you have additional measures of control over stored data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to the System is password protected, which you can change at any time.</li>
        <li>
          When you delete a "Connection" to a 3rd party system, (ie Quickbooks, Salesforce), all associated data is
          permanently erased from our infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you delete a "Client", all associated data from all connected systems is permanently erased from our
          infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alpyne offers a feature wherein you can create a publicly available (not password-protected) dashboard. This
          feature is opt-in and only available if you explicitly allow it. Additionally, the URL for the dashboard is
          based on a lengthy alphanumeric string.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Integration with Google Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our service integrates with Google APIs to provide functionality for our users. When you authorize our
        application, we request specific permissions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Google Sheets Access: We request access to your Google Sheets to create, edit, and manage spreadsheets where
          your financial data is stored and analyzed. This allows us to automate the transfer of data from external
          sources like QuickBooks and Shopify directly into your sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Google Sheets Read-Only Access: In some cases, we may only need to read your spreadsheet data to perform
          analysis without making changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Google Ads Access: For customers who wish to incorporate marketing analytics into their financial reporting,
          we request access to Google Ads account data.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We only access the minimum data necessary to provide our services. Our systems use OAuth 2.0 for authentication,
        ensuring we never see or store your Google passwords.
      </p>

      <h2>International Data Privacy Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        For users in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or California, we comply with applicable data
        protection laws including GDPR and CCPA. This includes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The right to access your personal data</li>
        <li>The right to correct inaccurate data</li>
        <li>The right to delete your data</li>
        <li>The right to restrict or object to processing</li>
        <li>The right to data portability</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To exercise these rights, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@getalpyne.com">support@getalpyne.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>
        From time-to-time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about material changes in the way we
        treat personal information by posting a revised version of this Privacy Policy to the Site. We encourage you to
        periodically check back and review this statement so that you will know what information we collect, how we use
        it, and with whom we share it.
